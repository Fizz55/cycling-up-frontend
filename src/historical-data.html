          The total amount of cyclable paths is calculated in kilometers and
          includes the ones separated from the main roads as well as the
          suggested paths or the Regional Cyclable Itineraries (RCI). The RCIs
          are suggested paths for cyclists willing to commute on a medium to
          long distance. These itineraries take into account the calmest streets
          and the less stressful paths for the users. The accuracy of the really
          past data (1896-1970) are less reliable in terms of consistency.
          Nonetheless, the overall data remain as close as possible to the
          reality and can be trustworthy on a holistic vision of the
          infrastructure evolution.
