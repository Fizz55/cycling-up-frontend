                  The total amount of cyclable paths is calculated in kilometers and
                  includes the ones separated from the main roads as well as the
                  suggested paths and the Regional Cyclable Itineraries (RCI). The
                  RCIs are suggested paths for cyclists willing to commute on a
                  medium to long distance. These itineraries take into account the
                  calmest streets and the less stressful paths for the users. The
                  accuracy of the really past data (1896-1970) are less reliable in
                  terms of consistency. Nonetheless, the overall data remain as
                  close as possible to the reality and can be trustworthy on a
                  holistic vision of the infrastructure evolution. A significant
                  year to mention is 2002, where the political courage and boldness
                  allowed the apparition of a project considered as not realistic at
                  its time.
