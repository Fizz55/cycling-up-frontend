                  Villo! is a rental programme run in the region of Brussels capital.
                  It aims at enhancing and encouraging sustainable mobility to citizens.
                  Bikes can be rented out from the actual 360 existing stations.
                  The graph displays the total amount of Villo! users recorded from 2010 till 2017.
                  The steady rise between this period of time is related to the increasing demand
                  as well as the rise of the number of stations available.
